indesign-rgb-color-importer
===========================

Quick and dirty copy/paste-hack i threw together to import some color swatches from a csv-file to InDesign CS6.

It generates an .ase file next to the .csv file being imported that can be imported into the InDesign Color Palette.

CMYK script found on the web somewhere, modified it to handle RGB together with Javascript color conversion library from http://www.webtoolkit.info
